# scala_svm

It's part of codes of my first progamme using scala. 

The input data can be process through this code(converting to RDD frame automatically). 

And, don't need to covert it to RDD type.

Before putting on, I add some comprehensible connotations.

Yet, this first version have a far long way to be modify.
